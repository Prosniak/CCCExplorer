# CCCExplorer

CCCExplorer is a java-based software that predicts and visualizes the gene signaling network to aid research on crosstalk identification in the tumor microenvironment. 
CCCExplorer integrates a computational model that we developed to uncover cell-cell communication as a direct and connected network. These cell communications range from ligand-receptor interactions to transcription factors and their target genes.
